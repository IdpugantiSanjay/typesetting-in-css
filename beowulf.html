    <h1>Beowulf</h1>
    <h2>The Life and Death of Scyld</h2>
    <p>
      Lo! the Spear-Danes’ glory through splendid achievements
      <span>   
        <br>The folk-kings’ former fame we have heard of,
        <br>How princes displayed then their prowess-in-battle.
      </span>
      <br>Oft <a href="">Scyld</a> the Scefing from scathers in numbers
      <!-- <br><span>...</span> -->
      <br>From many a people their mead-benches tore.
      <br>Since first he found him friendless and wretched,
      <br>The earl had had terror: comfort he got for it,
      <br>Waxed ’neath the welkin, world-honor gained,
      <br>Till all his neighbors o’er sea were compelled to
      <br>Bow to his bidding and bring him their tribute:
      <br>An excellent atheling! After was borne him
      <br>A son and heir, young in his dwelling,
      <br>Whom God-Father sent to solace the people.
      <br>He had marked the misery malice had caused them,
      <br>That reaved of their rulers they wretched had erstwhile
      <br>Long been afflicted. The Lord, in requital,
      <br>Wielder of Glory, with world-honor blessed him.
      <br>Famed was <a class="decoration-none text-decoration-line-all" href="">Beowulf</a>, far spread the glory
      <br>Of <a class="double overline" href="">Scyld</a>’s great son in the lands of the <a  class="dotted line-through" href="">Danemen</a>.
      <br>So the carle that is young, by kindnesses rendered
      <br>The friends of his father, with fees in abundance
      <br>Must be able to earn that when age approacheth
      <br>Eager companions aid him requitingly,
      <br>When war assaults him serve him as liegemen:
      <br>By praise-worthy actions must honor be got
      <!-- <br><span>...</span> -->
      <br>’Mong all of the races. At the hour that was fated
      <br><a class="underline" href="">Scyld</a> dies at the hour appointed by Fate.
      <!-- <br><span>...</span> -->
      <br><a class="wavy" href="">Scyld</a> then departed to the All-Father’s keeping
      <br>Warlike to wend him; away then they bare him
      <br>To the flood of the current, his fond-loving comrades,
      <br>As himself he had bidden, while the friend of the Scyldings
      <br>Word-sway wielded, and the well-lovèd land-prince
      <br>Long did rule them. The ring-stemmèd vessel,
      <br>Bark of the atheling, lay there at anchor,
      <br>Icy in glimmer and eager for sailing;
      <br>The belovèd leader laid they down there,
      <br>Giver of rings, on the breast of the vessel,
      <br>The famed by the mainmast. A many of jewels,
      <br>Of fretted embossings, from far-lands brought over,
      <br>Was placed near at hand then; and heard I not ever
      <br>That a folk ever furnished a float more superbly
      <br>With weapons of warfare, weeds for the battle,
      <br>Bills and burnies; on his bosom sparkled
      <br>Many a jewel that with him must travel
      <br>On the flush of the flood afar on the current.
      <br>And favors no fewer they furnished him soothly,
      <br>Excellent folk-gems, than others had given him
      <br>Who when first he was born outward did send him
      <br>Lone on the main, the merest of infants:
      <br>And a gold-fashioned standard they stretched under heaven
      <br>High o’er his head, let the holm-currents bear him,
      <br>Seaward consigned him: sad was their spirit,
      <br>Their mood very mournful. Men are not able
      <br>Soothly to tell us, they in halls who reside,4
      <br>Heroes under heaven, to what haven he hied.
